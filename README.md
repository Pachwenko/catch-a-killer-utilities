This never turned out to be helpful. Some code on here might be useful somewhere else like the dynamic save/load to local system. If you really need help I would suggest the official hints and https://cryptii.com/.

In the [murder mystery game Hunt A Killer](https://www.huntakiller.com/) you must solve some puzzles (or ciphers) which require some monotonous work and sometimes are very tricky. This isn't the solution to those (you can use the provided cheats if you want that). This is rather some tools to make solving those easier. 

Currently used in my investigation into the murder of Viola Vane. If we continue playing perhaps this will be expanded to more murders and ciphers.</s>
